      summary:
        "<p><b>Suits</b> delves into the fast-paced, high-stakes world of a top Manhattan corporate law firm where hotshot associate Harvey Specter makes a risky move by hiring Mike Ross a brilliant but unmotivated college dropout, as his associate. As he becomes enmeshed in this unfamiliar world, Mike relies heavily on the firm's best paralegal Rachel Zane and Harvey's no-nonsense assistant Donna Paulsen to help him serve justice. With a photographic memory and the street smarts of a hustler, Mike proves to be a legal prodigy despite the absence of bonafide legal credentials.</p>",
